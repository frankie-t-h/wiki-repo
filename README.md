# wiki-repo

This repository has been created with the aim to guide you building a repo for a wiki project on Github.

Github is a platform opensource where you can keep your projects or as in this case a documentation using **wiki pages**.

Wiki pages are like single pages, similar to the pages of a book collected in the same wiki like a virtual folder.

Github browser version "render pages written in **markup language**". A markup language is a computer language that uses tags to define elements within a document. 
It is human-readable, meaning markup files contain standard words, rather than typical programming syntax.The two most popular are HTML and XML.

Github simplified its markup a language and in the next tutorial we will show you how to use it.
